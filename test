A repository is usually used to organize a single project. 
Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. 
GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
It also offers other common options such as a license file.
